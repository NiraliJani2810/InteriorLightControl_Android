# Interior Light Control â€“ Android Application

This Android application connects to a custom-built interior lighting system powered by a CC3200 LaunchPad. It allows real-time monitoring and manual control of a relay based on data from a light sensor and rotary dial. The system supports both auto and manual modes, with override capability, and provides sensor status via a local WiFi Access Point.

---

## Features

- Connects to the CC3200 via WiFi Access Point (SSID: `LightControlAP`)
- Displays real-time sensor data: mode, relay state, light intensity, rotary value
- Manual relay control and mode switching
- Responsive theme switching (Light/Dark mode)
- Connection status feedback
- Light condition visualization with color-coded card

---

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Electric Eel or newer)
- Physical Android device or emulator with WiFi capabilities
- Access to the CC3200 LaunchPad with the corresponding `.ino` firmware running

---

## Installation

### 1. CC3200 Hardware Setup

- Flash the `InteriorLightControl.ino` sketch to your CC3200 LaunchPad using Energia
- Ensure the AP starts with SSID: `LightControlAP`, password: `12345678`
- Relay, light sensor, and rotary should be wired as described in the hardware README

### 2. Android Studio Project Setup

- Open this Android project in Android Studio
- Ensure the following permissions are declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
  ```
- Run the app on a device/emulator
- Connect the device to the `LightControlAP` WiFi network created by the CC3200

---

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Ensure connection to `LightControlAP` (WiFi icon will update)
3. View current mode, relay state, light value, and rotary position
4. Tap the switch or buttons to:
   - Manually turn the relay ON/OFF (activates override)
   - Switch between auto and manual modes
5. View light condition levels as:
   - Dark, Dim, Normal, Bright, Very Bright
